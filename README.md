# Foraging behavior diagnostics
Purpose: taking data from PharaGlow and analyzing the velocity and pumping of worm strains to get a sense of what the general trend of the data is.

What to do:

1. Download the Post-pharaglow_V&P_analysis.ipynb file.

2. Change file directories, variables, etc. where (user input required) is stated, there should be instructions on what to change as comments. If anything could be made clearer then just let me know and I'll add to it :)!

  a) One set should be at the very beginning.

  b) The second set is under the plotting portion - here you MUST add sub-plots manually for every strain added to the analysis.

3. Wait for all of your data to be loaded into the notebook (for 3 strains this took around 2 hours) and the figures should save themselves automatically unless commented out in the plotting section.
