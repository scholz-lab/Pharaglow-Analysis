# Foraging-behavior-velocity
Purpose: taking data from pharaglow and analyzing the velocity of worm trajectories to create half of our big foraging figure.

What to do:
1. Download the notebook Analyzing_updated_pharaglow(with_rerouting).ipynb
2. Change the file name, figure names and fps the videos were taken at where stated in the script (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT as
   otherwise you may end up overwriting files you don't want to overwrite)
     a) Make sure the file only contains "_results.json" or "_trajectories.json" files
     b) If there are multiple pharaglow analyzed videos with the same condition (e.g. 1x lawn concentration) then combine them
        into a single results folder
3. Run the script and wait for the analysis to finish! That easy!
